* FalsiScan: Make it look like a PDF has been hand signed and scanned
#+begin_abstract
For bureaucratic reasons, a colleague of mine had to print, sign, scan and send by email a high number of pages.
To save trees, ink, time, and to stick it to the bureaucrats, I wrote this script.
#+end_abstract
[[file:falsiscan.png]]
** Usage
*** Create a signature sample
- Print the [[file:Signature_guide.pdf]], 
- sign in each of the full sized box (this will give 27 different signatures),
- scan the resulting paper and save it as a pdf (called e.g. =signatures.pdf=),
- run =./signdiv.sh signatures.pdf=,
- check in =signatures= that you have 27 png files correctly cropped. You can manually edit the .png files to your liking.


You can maintain multiple signature directories, or run the above again if you want more than 27 signatures.
*** False-sign and False-scan a document
- Get the PDF the bureaucrats want you to print, sign and scan (e.g. =document.pdf=),
- run =./falsisign.sh document.pdf signatures 1000 2500 document-scanned.pdf=:
  - The first argument is the document you need to sign/scan
  - The second argument is the directory with all your different signatures
  - The next two arguments are the X and Y coordinates of where your signature will be. The page dimension is 3560x4752.
  - The last argument is the output file name.
